# phu




phu (phage utilities) or phutilities, is a modular toolkit for viral genomics workflows. It provides command-line tools to handle common steps in phage bioinformatics pipelinesâ€”wrapping complex utilities behind a consistent and intuitive interface.

The first implemented module, seqclust, brings flexible clustering strategies for viral contigs and genomes, with additional modules under active development.

## Installation
